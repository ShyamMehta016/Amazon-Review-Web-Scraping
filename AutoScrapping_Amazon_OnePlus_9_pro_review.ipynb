Oneplus is this your premium Phone??? COMMON... I am very disappointed buying this. I initially thought my phone might be defective, but i researched more about this, I found a Forum Thread in Oneplus Website where everyone is complaining of Over Heating issues. You cannot even record a 4k video for 60 sec, phone overheats and stops the recording. Forget 8K recording.. Just read the thread in OnePlus Forum, others cannot even click photo, phone overheats and stops the camera... What is this ONEPLUS? You better release an software update and fix this mess. This is not expected from premium phone like this. I will not change One Star until you fix this Over Heating issue. VERY MUCH DISSAPOINTED.\"]"
